The λᵢ are called the parts of the partition. We encode a partition as an array with elements λᵢ. To be able to conceptually work with partitions we have implemented an own type Partition{T} as subtype of AbstractArray{T,1}. All functions for arrays then also work for partitions. You may increase performance by using smaller integer types, see the example below. For efficiency, the Partition constructor does not check whether the given array is in fact a partition, i.e. a decreasing sequence.\n\nFor more general information on partitions, check out Wikipedia.\n\nExample\n\njulia> P=Partition([3,2,1]) #The partition 3+2+1 of 6\njulia> sum(P) #The sum of the parts.\n6\njulia> P[1] #First component\n3\njulia> P=Partition(Int8[3,2,1]) #Same partition but using 8 bit integers\n\nRemarks\n\nUsually, |λ| ≔ n is called the size of λ. In Julia, the function size for arrays already exists and returns the dimension of an array. Instead, you can use sum to get the sum of the parts.\nThere is no performance impact by using an own type for partitions rather than simply using arrays—I've tested this. Julia is great. The implementation of a subtype of AbstractArray is explained in the Julia documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"combinatorics.html#JuLie.partitions","page":"Combinatorics","title":"JuLie.partitions","text":"partitions(n::Integer)\n\nA list of all partitions of an integer n ≥ 0, produced in lexicographically descending order.

The box in row i and and column j has the coordinates (i,j). Listing the number of boxes in each row gives a partition λ of a non-negative integer n (the total number of boxes of the diagram). The diagram is then said to be of shape λ. Conversely, one can associate to any partition λ a Young diagram in the obvious way, so Young diagrams are just another way to look at partitions.\n\nA Young tableau of shape λ is a filling of the boxes of the Young diagram of λ with elements from some set. After relabeling we can (and will) assume that we fill from a set of integers from 1 up to some number, which in applications is often equal to n.

(Don't take this too seriously, but at least try.)\nFor every function you implement, there has to be a reasonable test in test/runtests.jl. You can run the complete unit test with Pkg.test(\"JuLie\").\nFor large number arithmetic we use Nemo (type fmpz with constructor ZZ for integers, type fmpq with constructor QQ for rationals, etc.). See the file src/enum_func.jl for examples. For more general rings (polynomial rings, laurent polynomial rings, etc.) we use AbstractAlgebra, see src/quantum_numbers.jl for examples.
