The box in row i and and column j has the coordinates (i,j). Listing the number of boxes in each row gives a partition λ of a non-negative integer n (the total number of boxes of the diagram). The diagram is then said to be of shape λ. Conversely, one can associate to any partition λ a Young diagram in the obvious way, so Young diagrams are just another way to look at partitions.\n\nA Young tableau of shape λ is a filling of the boxes of the Young diagram of λ with elements from some set. After relabeling we can (and will) assume that we fill from a set of integers from 1 up to some number, which in applications is often equal to n. We encode a tableau as an array of arrays and we have implemented an own type Tableau{T}\tas subtype of AbstractArray{AbstractArray{T,1},1} to work with tableaux. As for partitions, you may increase performance by casting into smaller integer types, e.g.\n\nFor efficiency, we do not check whether the given array is really a tableau, i.e. whether the structure of the array defines a partition.\n\nExample\n\njulia> Tab=Tableau([[1,2,3],[4,5],[6]])\njulia> Tab=Tableau(Array{Int8,1}[[2,1], [], [3,2,1]]) #Using 8 bit integers\n\nReferences\n\nWikipedia, Young tableau.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"combinatorics/tableaux/#Operations","page":"Tableaux","title":"Operations","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"combinatorics/tableaux/","page":"Tableaux","title":"Tableaux","text":"hook_length\nhook_lengths\nshape\nweight\nreading_word","category":"page"},{"location":"combinatorics/tableaux/#JuLie.hook_length","page":"Tableaux","title":"JuLie.hook_length","text":"hook_length(lambda::Partition, i::Integer, j::Integer)\n\nConsider the Young diagram of a partition λ.
